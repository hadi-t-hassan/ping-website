# Client Logos

Place your client logo images in this folder with the following naming convention:

- `edtechs-logo.png` - EdTechS (Syndicate of Educational Technology in Lebanon)
- `get-logo.png` - GET (Global Education & Technology)  
- `iet-logo.png` - IET (Interactive Education Technology)
- `ridha-logo.png` - Al-Imam Al-Ridha High School
- `sadiq-logo.png` - Al-Imam Al-Sadiq International High School
- `ayat-logo.png` - Ayat Quranic Foundation

The images should be:
- PNG format (preferred) or JPG
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Minimum 200x200 pixels
- Maximum 500x500 pixels
- Transparent background (for PNG)

If an image is not found, the component will fallback to showing the first letter of the client name in a gradient circle.
